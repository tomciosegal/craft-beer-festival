The goal was to:

not necessary to drink several pints of beer and go home. 
- make it available for wider group of people not only beer lovers, but also for someone 
who is tired after all week and would like to chill, eat some 
lovely food, listen to the music, feel and smell nature not only beer.

## Testing

It tested continually as I developed it, in Firefox Developer and Chrome, 
using both Firefox and Chromium developer tools, and nearing the conclusion of 
the project also on other physical devices. Also before deployment i checked also in
Opera and Safari.
I used responsive mode in the dev tools and resizing the viewport to find unwanted 
behavior  so as to correct it. I also periodically checked the appearance on both my 
phone and tablet (both Android) in Chrome. 
I continually  tested code in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
in order to get rid of errors. 
Testing my CSS in the [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) revealed few errors that I cloud identify and fix.
